## Problem Statement
- We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
  - Example Inputs
    - object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
    - key = a/b/c
    - object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
    - key = x/y/z
    - value = a

## How to run
- Open the Challenge-3 folder
  - Run`python .\keyParse.py`
- It will ask you to input the key
  - `What key would you like to find?`
  - `Enter the key which you need to find in format like a/b/c or x/y/z`
